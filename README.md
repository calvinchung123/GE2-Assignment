# GE2-Assignment
Games engines 2 assignment- recreating a battle using steering behaviours
# Theme
The theme I chose for this project was a futuristic mecha battle. This battle takes place on a war torn earth in 
a desert location. I got inspiration for this idea from a childhood anime I used to watch -Gundam. This anime contains a lot of
battles that have a similar setting.
# StoryLine
The battle will begin with an announcement, you (the commander) are told that the stronghold is under attack by the enemy. This scene 
will then transition to a UI interface which the user will set up the army to fight against the enemy. 
# Assets Chosen:
For this project i split my assets into two seperate folders. One for units and one for the terrain i am going to use. 
### Units
For this project there are 3 styles of units to choose from: 
1. Infantry
2. Mecha
3. Air

For each of the unit types there are 2 models for each representing the two sides. 
### Terrain
As stated this battle is held on a war torn earth. I will create a dessert terain and populate it with different abandoned buildings
which the units can battle inside. 

# Concept of the battle
For this battle there will be 2 armies, one on each side of the battlefield. Using steering behaviours the units will move towards 
eachother resulting in a battle in the middle of the map. Following the concept of real-time strategy games this game will have a unit 
cap eg.100 **(this value can be changed by the user)** . Units will be worth a certain value towards the cap (eg. Infantry is worth 3 
towards cap), the user selects the units for the battle and commences the battle when the cap is full.

# Steering Behaviours
For this assgigment I will be using all of the steering behaviours covered in class. A new steering behaviour i wihs to implement is a moral behaviour. When a team of units lose their leader/are under heavy fire from the enemy, they begin to lose moral. When moral reaches its lower threshold the units will begin to run around frantically.
