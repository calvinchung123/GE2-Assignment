# GE2-Assignment
Games engines 2 assignment- recreating a sci-fi scene of choice using steering behaviours
# Theme
The theme I chose for this project was a retreival mission for a mecha suit.  
# StoryLine
A task force is sent out to find the lost mech on a desserted planet.

### Scene 1 - Space Ship Scene
This scene consists of the space ship approaching the planet. This scene uses the seek and arrive steering behaviours to steer the ship.  

### Scene 2 - Planet Landing
The ship has approached the planet and sent a drop pod with a task force inside. This scene uses the arrive and seek steering behaviours to direct the pod to the planet.

### Scene 3 - Ground troops search
This is the last scene of the short film. The ground troops have landed and are searching for the lost mech suit. The steering behaviours used in this scene consists of path following to navigate through the city aswell as obstacle avoidance to avoid the terrain where neccessary. There are 6 camera angles in this scene. The first two are attached to the individual squads. One rear at the rear of one squad and another at the front of the other. The other camera angles chosen are random points in the scene where the troops move through. 
The last part of this short movie is them finding the mech. 

### Remarks
For this assignment no new steering behaviour was created. 
The original idea was changed. This was due to time constraints unfortunately.
